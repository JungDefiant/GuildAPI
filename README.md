# GuildAPI
**Authors:** Bryant Davis, Lesley Rivera, Peyton Cysewski, Bade Habib

# Description
This is a service for managing Guilds in online games. Developers can download this API onto their own backend servers for an out-of-the-box solution to Guild management systems. By default, the service allows clients to create new guilds, manage ranks, and control roles.

## User Stories

1) A User that wants to create a multiplayer game wants an API that will create the basic structure of the guild portion of their game so that it will
save them time, planning and money.

2) A User wants to manage their guilds in the database so that they can control their game guilds from their own server.

3) A User wants the data organized by game so that they can view the different games they have in development.

4) A User wants to anonymously view games and guilds so that that they can view the data prior to getting authorization.

5) As a User I want added security measures to ensure my data cannot be manipulated so that I know my data is only being manipulated by my team.
